### Export to GIF

Save the credits as a high-quality GIF — perfect for READMEs, presentations, or sharing.

```bash
gitcredits --output credits.gif
gitcredits --output credits.gif --theme matrix
```

Requires [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/):

```bash
brew install vhs ffmpeg
```

VHS records the terminal in real-time, and ffmpeg converts it to an optimized GIF with 2-pass palette generation for maximum quality.

### Controls

## What it shows

- **ASCII art title** from your repo name
- **Project lead** — top contributor by commits
- **Contributors** — everyone who committed
- **Notable scenes** — recent `feat:` and `fix:` commits
- **Stats** — total commits, contributors, GitHub stars, language, license

GitHub metadata (stars, description, license) requires [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to be installed and authenticated. Works without it — you'll just get git-only data.

## Requirements

- **git** (required) — commit history, contributors, repo info
- **Go 1.21+** — for `go install`
- [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (optional) — enables GitHub stars, license, language, and description
- [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) + [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (optional) — required for `--output` GIF export
